# Amazon-Sentiment-Analysis-Model

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.

Sentiment analysis is the process of detecting positive or negative sentiment in text. It’s often used by businesses to detect sentiment in social data, gauge brand reputation, and understand customers.

Since customers express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before, sentiment analysis is becoming an essential tool to monitor and understand that sentiment. Automatically analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations, allows brands to learn what makes customers happy or frustrated, so that they can tailor products and services to meet their customers’ needs.

In this project, I have implemented a Sentiment Analysis model on Amazon Alexa reviews. Using principal NLP processes like tokenization, stemming, removing punctuations & stopwords, using CountVectorizer along with Naive Bayes Classifier or Logistic Regression, we can predict whether their customers are satisfied with the product or not.
